# My Automation Projects

## Expense Tracking Automation

> This is my first ever automation project. I used n8n to build this workflow, with the additional assistance from ChatGPT to create a regular expression (RegEx). Apart from that, I did not use AI to scan through my transactions, since I'm not comfortable sharing my transaction data with a proprietary model.
> **The problem**: I'm having trouble keeping track of my monthly expenses. Maintaining a daily transaction log is just too much hassle for me. I ended up forgetting to log some of the transactions made.
> **The solution**: I build an automated workflow that can log and categorize my transactions based on the transaction receipts that I received on my personal email.
> **Disclaimer**: I have a couple of mobile banking apps, but I am limiting my expense-tracking scope to the top 3 apps that I used the most. This workflow also exclue transactions made on my credit card, except for the ones made on 1 particular ride-hailing app that I used daily.

# About Me

I'm a full-time banker who is currently on a self-discovery journey; exploring AI, automations, and more. I will be sharing my journey and project portfolio here. ### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
